	Welcome Tovarish!
	
You have been chosen to
represent Matushka Rossiya in
this space race between us and
the Americans.
Your job will be to lead this
agency which will be responsible
for realisation of our most
advanced projects.
You learned under best of our
scientist and technicians and
we hope that with your help 
Motherland will conquer space!

	Welcome Tovarish!

Your first task is very basic
and easy, but still important
as you have to be tested.
You have been assigned to
project 'Semyorka', the R-7
missile, which should be
capable of intercontinental
flights.
You have to cooperate with
our scientists to build it.
Good luck Tovarish!

===		===		 2		===		===

	R-7 Semyorka

First launched in 1957,the R-7
is Soviet intercontinental
ballistic missile (worlds
first) and orbital launch
vehicle.
After many modifications
it is still used as orbital
launcher today, for example
in Soyuz-FG.

	Good job!
	
You have completed your first
task!
Now the motherland has
intercontinental ballistic
missile before USA and we can 
protect our poor citizens
from democracy.

	Next job!
	
Your second assignment will be
something big now. You will
help building the Sputnik
program rockets!
Your first task in this team 
will be to build unmanned probe
which will become first
artificial Earth satellite.
You better hurry - you don't
want to fail Matushka Rossiya.

===		===		 3		===		===

	Sputnik 1
	
Sputnik 1 was the first 
artificial Earth satellite.
It was launched with 8K71PS,
modified R-7 rocket.
It was mainly technology
demonstration and great
propaganda for Soviet
technology.
It's success was major event
in the Cold War which triggered
creation of NASA and is
considered as beginning of
'Space Race'.

	Good job!

Congratulations, I'm starting
to believe that putting you in
charge of technicians was a
good decision.
We have proven, that Soviets
is better than the West and we
launched vessel to space before
them.

	Next job!

But unmanned probe is just the
first step to put man in space.
To ensure our conquer of space
we have to send human into
space.
But before that we should send
something on smaller scale, an
animal for example.
Your job will be to choose an
animal and adapt Sputnik 1
probe to fit it.
Good luck!

===		===		 4		===		===

	Sputnik 2
	
First spacecraft to carry a
living animal, a dog named
Laika, which died after
several hours in space,
due to high temperature in
cabin.
It was important source of
information about behavior
of a living organism in
space environment.

	Good job!
	
You have completed our task
successfully!
The dog survived only few
hours, but some propaganda
will make it alive for a
week in space.

	Next job!
	
Our scientists recently
finished Luna project and it
will be your responsibility
to build it.
Don't fail us.
Good luck!

===		===		 5		===		===

	Luna 1
	
First spacecraft to get close
to the moon and the first one
to be placed on the orbit of
the Sun itself.
It was designed to orbit moon,
but due to incorrectly timed
upper stage burn it missed and
escaped Earth gravitation.

	Good job!
	
You managed to build Luna 1,
but one of the scientist failed
to calculate proper burn time.
Maybe he will learn some basic
math in gulag.
Anyway we have next job for you!

	Next job!
	
Our scientists claim that they
fixed all Luna 1 problems, so
maybe this time we will be able
to celebrate success.
Build Luna 2 as fast as you
can.
Good luck.

===		===		 6		===		===

	Luna 2
	
Sharing similar, but still a
bit different, design Luna 2
finally reached moon and
collided with it, which was
first objective of Luna
programme.

	Good job!
	
You keep me amazed. 
For sixth time you have 
fulfilled my expectations.
It's a honor for your family.

	Next job!
	
Thanks to our success in last
flight we can now pretty well
calculate how to reliably get
to the moon.
Therefore your next project
to build will be Luna 3,
satellite which will photograph
far side of the moon.
Build it fast, we want to do it
before this spoiled Western
NASA institution.
Good luck!

===		===		 7		===		===

	Luna 3
	
Although it brought low quality
pictures Luna 3 was the first
ever mission to photograph far
side of the moon and it caused
world wide excitement.
Luna 3 was also important due to
first ever gravity assist
manouver - it used moon
gravitation to alter its orbit
so it could land on the Northern
hemisphere of the Earth where
Soviets could retrieve it
without trouble.

	Good job!
	
You succeeded in building Luna
3 on time. Thanks to you we can
once more show Soviet
superiority over disgusting
West.

	Next job!
	
Now we have very important
mission for you. 
Our scientists recently 
developed way to transport
human to space.
Your job will be to build
Vostok 1, rocket which will
be used to transport Yuri
Gagarin to space.
You better do it correctly,
we want him back on Earth.
Good luck!

===		===		 8		===		===

	Vostok 1
	
It was the first manned
spaceflight in history.
Yuri Gagarin has stayed up
for one orbit at 169
kilometers at lowest point.
The flight took 108 minutes
and Yuri landed safely after
ejecting himself at 7 kilometers
and parachuting himself
separately from his capsule.

	Good job!
	
You helped to bring glory to
Matushka Rossiya, we were the
first to bring human into space!
It is honour to you and your
family to take part in this.
Today we can celebrate!

	Next job!
	
But from tomorrow we have to get
to work!
We have plans on sending
Valentina Tereshkova to space
together with equipment to 
transmit her flight on live tv
and to contact her with ground
on the radio.
Good luck!

===		===		 9		===		===

	Vostok 6
	
Vostok 6 was first mission
to carry a woman, Valentina
Tereshkova, to space. 
Spacecraft used was called
Vostok 3KA, it was first used
in Vostok 1 mission and this 
one was its last.
Soviet state TV broadcasted
live video of Valentina from a
camera inside capsule and she
even conversed with Premier
Nikita Khrushchev over the
radio.
During flight an error occured
which made the rocket ascend
from orbit instead of descend.
Flight controllers provided
Tereshkova with data to enter
into descend program and finally
she landed safely.

	Good job!
	
You handled the job perfectly.
I hope you will continue to
amaze us during our next 
assignments.

	Next job!
	
Speak of the devil - we have
new job for you.
We renamed Vostok program to
Voskhod and we are now ready
for first extra-vehicular
activity, or just spacewalk if
you prefer.
Your task, as always, will be
to construct this spacecraft,
so you better get to work.
Good luck!

===		===		 10		===		===

	Voskhod 2
	
Voskhod 2 mission was very
important one, as it was the
first time human has ever left
the spacecraft and fully
experienced space.
Alexei Leonov made 12 minute
EVA or 'spacewalk', which nearly
ended fatal for him as he nearly
suffered heatstroke, he got
stuck while entering back to the
spacecraft and flirted with
decompression sickness.
In the end he returned safely to
Earth being the first man in
history to perform spacewalk.

	Good job!
	
You have done really well.
You helped fellow Tovarish
Leonov be the first one to ever
be outside spacecraft in space!

	Next job!
	
Our new assignment for you will
be to help Venera programme in
building probe which will land
on planet Venus.
Good luck!

===		===		 11		===		===

	Venera 3

First probe to reach and land
Venus was Venera 3.
Venera 3 comprised of probe and
flyby spacecraft.
First one was supposed to enter
and land on the planed and the
second carried mentioned probe
and served also as communication
relay.

	Good job!
	
It is very pleasing to work with
you.
I hope you will keep to suprise
us in the future during next
assignments.
And speak of the devil!

	Next job!
	
Since our great Tovarish Sergey
Korolev died landing on the Moon
is not that important anymore.
For now we are focusing on
making an orbital station and
therefore you are assigned to
Salyut programme.
Good luck!

===		===		 12		===		===

	Salyut 1
	
Salyut 1 was the first space
station of any kind.
It was launched into low Earth
orbit where it was flying for
175 days.
It carried 3 crew members for
over 23 days, which was record
for that time.
Unfortunatelly due to pressure
relief valve malfunction all
crew members died during 
re-entry as they weren't wearing
pressure suits.
It was deorbited then as there
was not enough fuel to keep it
on place without rotating.

	Good job!
	
Maybe the mission wasn't
complete success, but still it
was quite impressive.
We have redesigned Soyuz cabins
so such accident never happens
again.
But the times have changed and
our leaders are talking with USA
about becoming friendly again.
To improve relations between us
we will have to cooperate with
NASA in space.
We will send our newest design,
Soyuz 19 to meet Apollo rocket
and dock into it.
So as usual you will have to
build Soyuz rocket.
Good luck!

===		===		 13		===		===

	ASTP
	
Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP)
was a symbol of everything that
space race was and still is.
It was thought that ASTP will
make space race either more
cooperative or competitive and
instead it made it both of
above.
Mission became symbol of each
countries goals of scientific
cooperation, but both called
it their own success while
calling other ones spacecraft
primitive.
It is also seen in name of the
mission - in USA it is called
primarily Apollo-Soyuz mission,
while Soviets called it the
Soyuz-Apollo mission.
This mission marks the end of
Space Race started by Sputnik
launch.
It was also important for both
countries as experience from it
was used for future joint
missions such as ISS.
Moreover US and Soviet
commanders became lasting
friends.
One can now see docked Apollo
and Soyuz at the Cosmosphere
in Hutchinson, Kansas.

===		===		  END GAME		===		===

	Congratulations!
	
You have finished the game!
Soviets are now cooperating
with US and officially cold
wars space race is now over.
Thank you for playing

===		===		 GAME FAILED		===		===

	Game failed!
	
You failed your motherland
Tovarish. 
Because of this disgrase you
will be sent to gulag.
It was nice knowing you.
